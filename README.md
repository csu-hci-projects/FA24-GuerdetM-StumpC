## Creators
### Casey Stump and Mallory Guerdet-Schuster

## What Casey Did
* I did the design for level 2
* targets health and UI
* ammo pick-ups and UI to show the amount
* Added things from the Homework (targets, moving targets)
* targets destroy
* end game menu

## What Mallory Did
* I did the main menu when it comes to the UI and being able to connect that to a scene to where you load in you will be able to click either start (to load in level 1) or quit (this would exit the game).
* I also created level one and the design and added parts.
* I also did the spikes/traps that will deal -25 health to the player
* I also did the health pick up which adds +25 to the player
* I created the health bar and explained how to add it to the play and increase or decrease it.

  
## How to Run The Game
* When it comes to this game you should be able to just run it without anything specifically needed, maybe being able to open the HW1_Main_Menu
* The targets take 5 hits to disappear, unable to add a health bar to the targets.
* End main menu his 'Shift' +  'F1' to get the curser to come on screen
